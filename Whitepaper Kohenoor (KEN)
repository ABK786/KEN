Kohenoor (KEN)
Unified Digital Utility, Governance & Settlement Asset
Whitepaper – Version 1.1 (Final)	February 2026
________________________________________
1. Abstract
Kohenoor KEN (KEN) is the sole canonical digital asset of the Kohenoor ecosystem, deployed on Ethereum Mainnet as a hard-capped ERC-20 token. KEN serves as the native settlement, utility, and governance layer across a vertically integrated ecosystem spanning AI & Business Intelligence, DeFi & Mudharba services, tokenized education (Education 3.0), digital marketplaces, and professional training platforms.
This whitepaper defines the technical architecture, tokenomics, legacy migration framework, security posture, and real-world utility of KEN.

2. Vision & Philosophy
The Kohenoor ecosystem is built to unify:
•	Artificial Intelligence & Financial Intelligence
•	Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
•	Education 3.0 & Professional Enablement
KEN is designed as a functional digital asset, not a speculative abstraction — enabling access, settlement, incentives, and governance across all Kohenoor platforms.
One ecosystem. One ledger. One canonical token.

3. Token Overview
3.1 Token Specifications
Attribute	Details
Token Name	Kohenoor
Symbol	KEN
Standard	ERC-20
Network	Ethereum Mainnet
Contract Address	0x5f602133653237f362eb69826ba8237f4f7ab0c3

________________________________________
3.2 Contract Characteristics
•	Fixed supply minted at deployment
•	No inflation, no rebasing
•	No buy/sell tax
•	No proxy or hidden mint logic
•	Source code verified on-chain
Advanced functionality (staking, governance, services) is implemented outside the core ERC-20 contract via dedicated platforms.

4. Security, Audit & Transparency
4.1 Independent Security Assessments
•	FreshCoins Audit
https://www.freshcoins.io/audit/kohenoor
•	GoPlus Security Scan
https://gopluslabs.io/token-security/1/0x5f602133653237f362eb69826ba8237f4f7ab0c3
These reviews assess ownership risk, minting permissions, blacklist functions, honeypot behavior, and contract integrity.

5. Utility of KEN
KEN is the native digital utility asset across the Kohenoor ecosystem.
Primary functions include:
•	Settlement of platform services
•	Access to AI, BI, and trading intelligence
•	DeFi participation & Mudharba analytics
•	Education & certification access
•	Marketplace transactions
•	Governance participation (DAO roadmap)
________________________________________
6. Tokenomics & Supply Policy
6.1 Supply Discipline
•	Maximum supply: 101,966 KEN
•	Inflation: None
•	Minting: Permanently disabled
•	Burns: Legacy tokens only
KEN is a hyper-scarce digital asset by design, with supply integrity enforced through governance and migration rules. Burns may never be needed.
________________________________________
7. Legacy Tokens & Migration Framework
7.1 Legacy Tokens
Before Ethereum consolidation, two tokens existed:
•	KEN (C) — Corporate utility (BNB Chain)
•	KEN (P) — Payments utility (Polygon)
Both are now retired.
________________________________________
7.2 Final & Fixed Parity Ratios
Legacy Token	Network	Parity to KEN
KEN (C)	BNB Chain	1 : 1
KEN (P)	Polygon	500 : 1
Meaning:
•	1 KEN (C) on BSC → 1 KEN (ETH)
•	500 KEN (P) on Polygon → 1 KEN (ETH)
________________________________________
8. Burn-to-Unlock Supply Mechanics
8.1 Core Rule
Legacy tokens must be burned or permanently retired to unlock KEN.
All unlocks are constrained by the hard cap of 101,966 KEN.
________________________________________
8.2 Authoritative Conversion Examples
Legacy Burn	Nominal Parity	KEN Unlocked
100,000 KEN (C)	1 : 1	100,000 KEN
1,000,000 KEN (P)	500 : 1	1,966 KEN
Explanation:
•	Theoretical parity for 1,000,000 KEN (P) equals 2,000 KEN
•	Actual unlock limited to 1,966 KEN due to remaining supply availability
Burn eligibility does not override the immutable supply cap.
Excess theoretical entitlement is extinguished, not deferred.
________________________________________
8.3 Supply Integrity Guarantees
•	Burn occurs first
•	Unlock capped by remaining supply
•	No IOUs or future claims
•	One-way consolidation only

9. Products, Services & Acceptability of KEN
9.1 Core Platforms Powered by KEN
KEN functions as the native and preferred digital asset across:
•	KAI – AI & Business Intelligence
•	KENEX – Exchange & Tokenization Engine
•	K-Store – Digital marketplace
•	KENFI & Mudharba Services – AI-assisted portfolio intelligence
•	ProEdge – Professional & institutional training
•	Knowledge Gateway & Education 3.0 programs
KEN enables access, discounts, priority tiers, and native ecosystem benefits.
________________________________________
9.2 Acceptability Framework
•	KEN is the native digital settlement asset of the ecosystem
•	Certain services and premium tiers are:
o	Exclusively accessible via KEN, or
o	Discounted when settled in KEN
•	Fiat or other assets may be accepted selectively but do not receive native benefits
________________________________________
9.3 Partner-Enabled Adoption
Selected third-party partners have voluntarily opted to:
•	List products or services on K-Store denominated in KEN
•	Accept KEN as a settlement asset
Participation is voluntary, contractual, and policy-driven.
This demonstrates organic external adoption, extending KEN utility beyond internal platforms.
________________________________________
10. Governance & DAO Roadmap
KEN holders will progressively gain governance rights covering:
•	Platform upgrades
•	Treasury allocations
•	Ecosystem expansion priorities
•	Staking & incentive parameters
DAO implementation will be phased for security and compliance.
________________________________________
11. Roadmap (High-Level)
•	2025: Ethereum Mainnet consolidation
•	2026: Liquidity expansion, staking, DAO rollout
•	2026–2027: Full AI–DeFi–Education 3.0 integration
•	Beyond: Institutional and partner ecosystem growth
________________________________________

12. Risk Disclosure
KEN is a utility token. Participants acknowledge:
•	Market volatility
•	Regulatory uncertainty
•	Smart-contract interaction risks
•	No guaranteed returns
Users must conduct independent due diligence.
________________________________________
13. Final Canonical Statement
Kohenoor KEN (Ethereum) is the sole canonical token of the Kohenoor ecosystem.
All legacy tokens derive value only through burn-based conversion into KEN, strictly constrained by the immutable supply cap of 101,966 KEN.
